# Tokenized Supply Chain Regenerative Agriculture

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for tracking, verifying, and monetizing regenerative agriculture practices using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This system enables farmers to document their regenerative practices, track soil health improvements, quantify carbon sequestration, and access premium markets for their products. The platform creates transparency and trust in the regenerative agriculture supply chain while providing economic incentives for sustainable farming practices.

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Farm Verification Contract (`farm-verification.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Validates and manages agricultural operations
- **Key Features**:
    - Farm registration with location and size data
    - Authorized certifier management
    - Farm verification process
    - Verification status tracking

### 2. Practice Documentation Contract (`practice-documentation.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Records and tracks regenerative farming methods
- **Key Features**:
    - Document various regenerative practices (cover crops, crop rotation, composting, no-till, agroforestry)
    - Practice verification system
    - Regenerative score calculation
    - Implementation tracking

### 3. Soil Health Tracking Contract (`soil-health-tracking.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Monitors soil improvement metrics
- **Key Features**:
    - Record soil measurements (organic matter, pH, NPK levels)
    - Track soil health improvements over time
    - Measurement verification
    - Soil health scoring

### 4. Carbon Sequestration Contract (`carbon-sequestration.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Quantifies carbon storage benefits and issues credits
- **Key Features**:
    - Carbon measurement recording (soil and biomass)
    - Carbon credit issuance
    - Credit management and tracking
    - Verification system

### 5. Premium Marketplace Contract (`premium-marketplace.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Connects regenerative products with buyers
- **Key Features**:
    - Product listing with regenerative credentials
    - Premium pricing based on regenerative score
    - Carbon offset information
    - Purchase and payment system
